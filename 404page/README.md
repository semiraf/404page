# 404 Page
This is just one of my personal projects, I saw an article online and when I loaded the page, it gave me 
a 404 error. I decided to make a a responsive 404 page using HTML and CSS like the one I saw on my article.
There is no Javascript. I used basic HTML and CSS at an intermediate level.
